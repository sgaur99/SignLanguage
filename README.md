# Hand Gesture Recognition using Leap Motion Dataset

This project demonstrates a hand gesture recognition system using the [LeapGestRecog dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog/version/1), which contains 20,000 images of 10 different gestures from 10 subjects. The system uses TensorFlow for building a deep learning model capable of classifying hand gestures accurately.

| L                 | 2     |
| Fist (Horizontal) | 3     |
| Fist (Vertical)   | 4     |
| Thumbs up         | 5     |
| Index             | 6     |
| OK                | 7     |
| Palm (Vertical)   | 8     |
